                    How often should homes have the ductwork be cleaned?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frequency of cleaning depends on several factors, not the least of which is the preference of the homeowner. Some of the things that may lead a homeowner to consider more frequent cleaning include:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li>
                        smokers in the household
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        pets that shed high amounts of hair and dander
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        water contamination or damage to the home or HVAC system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        residents with allergies or asthma who might benefit from a reduction in the amount of indoor air pollutants in the home’s HVAC system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        after home renovations or remodeling

                    What Should I look for when choosing a duct cleaning contractor
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Consumers should also beware of “blow-and-go” air duct cleaning companies. These companies often charge a nominal fee and do a poor job of cleaning the heating and cooling system. These companies may also persuade the consumer to pay for unneeded services with and/or without their permission. (If you have knowledge of a practicing “blow-and-go” air duct cleaner, contact your local Better Business Bureau to report the company)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Print and web advertising promise unrealistically low prices to book the service call. Once into the door, you are presented with “new findings”.  By the time they leave your home, the invoice bears no resemblance with the advertised price that attracted you in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We pioneered the 5-step Ironclad Commitment® based on customer feedback and inspired by the best practices from other service businesses to take the guesswork out of duct cleaning.  After all, our business model is not to make a windfall on one service call but to generate continuous volume through repeat businesses and referrals. We have grown from a one truck operation to a 20 trucks operation with our busness model. We became Ontario’s largest duct cleaning service by following the mantra “Customer First”, not aggressive selling. We believe that if we serve every customer with integrity, business will grow naturally.
